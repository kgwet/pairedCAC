#' @title Paired t-test for the difference of 2 percent agreement coefficients
#'
#' @description
#' This function performs the paired t-test for testing the difference between
#' two correlated percent agreement coefficients for statistical significance.
#' It implements the linearization method of Gwet (2016).
#'
#' @param g1.ratings is a mandatory parameter representing the first data frame
#' of ratings.
#' @param g2.ratings is a mandatory parameter representing the second data frame
#' of ratings.
#' @param weights is an optional parameter that defines the weights needed in a
#' weighted analysis. It's default value is ``unweighted'' which requests the
#' unweighted analysis.
#' @param conflev, is an optional parameter representing the confidence level.
#' It's default value is 0.95.
#' @param N=, is an optional parameter representing the size of the subject
#' population. It's default value is infinity.
#'
#' @details
#' This function takes 2 required parameters, which are the 2 groups of raters
#' being compared: "g1.ratings" and "g2.ratings." Both datasets must have the
#' exact same number of rows, and each column represents one rater and
#' contains its ratings (numeric or alphabetic).
#' The user must exclude all subjects that are not rated by any rater.
