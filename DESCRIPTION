Description: pairedCAC is an R package that provides a series of functions to 
  test the difference of 2 Chance-corrected Agreement Coefficients (CAC) for 
  statistical significance. The CAC statistics covered are the percent 
  agreement, Fleiss' generalized kappa (includes Scott's pi as a special case),
  Conger's generalized kappa (includes Cohen's kappa as a special case), Gwet's
  AC1/AC2, Krippendorff's alpha, and Brennan-Prediger coefficient (includes 
  PABAK as a special case).
