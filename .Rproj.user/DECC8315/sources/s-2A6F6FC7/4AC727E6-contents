Description: pairedCAC is an R package that provides a series of functions to 
  test the difference of 2 Chance-corrected Agreement Coefficients (CAC) for 
  statistical significance. The CAC covered are the percent agreement, Fleiss'
  generalized kappa (includes Scott's pi as a special case), Conger's 
  generalized kappa (includes Cohen's kappa as a special case), Gwet's AC1/AC2,
  Krippendorff's alpha, and Brennan-Prediger coefficient (includes PABAK as a
  special case)
